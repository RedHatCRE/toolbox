      "message": "WOHA, this file is so huge...\n\nI am personally not a fan of such huge .gitignores from the project start, that include all possible and potential entries – such as for Java, C, Spyder and many other. I already lost too much time with my changes missing something because it was matched by one .gitignore entry (such as I can imagine here: lib/ and target/)\n\nAlso I just noticed it is ambiguous: why to specify all .idea/something, when line 87 lists `.idea/*`? But in line 251 there is `#.idea/`, so... should it be included, or excluded?",
